CAFE-MILANO-2.0 

Cafe Milano 2.0 is a simple React.js website for a coffee shop, featuring a navigation bar, a banner, and six coffee item cards. Each card displays the coffee's price, calories, preparation time, and includes an "Add to Cart" button. When the button is clicked, the specific item is added to the cart section, showing the name, calories, and preparation time of the selected coffee.
